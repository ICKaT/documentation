# Creating an Empire

When you join a galaxy, you will be able to choose the race of your empire's citizens.  Predefined races offer a variety of bonuses and penalties depending on the style you prefer to play. 

You also have an option to create a custom race with your choice of abilites and attributes. If this is your first time playing Imperial Conflict, it is recommended that you choose a predefined race.

Remember, you aren't allowed to have more then 1 account, even if they are in different galaxies.
