# Growing Your Empire

You will quickly outgrow your home planet, and need more space to build on.  The easiest way to do this is to explore an unclaimed planet. You are allowed to build more buildings than the listed maximum space. However, buildings built past this limit are subjected to a cost penalty that scales with each additional building put under construction. If a planet has twice as many buildings as that planet's max space, then the next building will cost twice as much as the base cost of that building. 

Your empire's population will increase according to normal exponential growth up to the max population on each planet. This growth is equal to "5% x pop growth race bonus" each hour.
